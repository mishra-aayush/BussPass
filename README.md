# BussPass

This application was created in an attempt to make the current Bus Pass System in our institute digital. 
It includes all forms of cashless payments like e-wallets, Net Banking, Payment via Credit/Debit Cards and much more. 
This feature was accomplished by using the Paytm Payment Gateway. 
The application includes several other features like an active alarm system, a notification system, and a reminder system. 
It makes use of Google's Firebase to store and fetch data in real-time. BussPass was created keeping in mind the college students that would be using the application.
